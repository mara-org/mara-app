# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. This helps future developers understand why certain decisions were made and provides context for future changes.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard in [this article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

- ADRs will be stored in `docs/architecture/decisions/`
- Each ADR will be numbered sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
- ADRs will follow the format:
  - Title
  - Status (Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded)
  - Context
  - Decision
  - Consequences
- ADRs help maintain architectural consistency
- Future developers can understand the reasoning behind decisions

## Notes

- This is the first ADR, establishing the ADR process itself
- Future ADRs will document specific architectural decisions
