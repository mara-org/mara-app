# Mara Security – PR Security Check
# Quick security checks for pull requests
# Runs lightweight security scans without full CI
# 
# INTENDED AS REQUIRED STATUS CHECK:
# This workflow should be configured as a required status check in GitHub branch protection rules.
# It will FAIL the job if critical/high-risk dependencies are outdated and can be upgraded.
# Low/medium issues will only print warnings.
