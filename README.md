## 🏗️ Architecture & Repositories

**Important:** This repository (`mara-app`) contains **only** the Flutter mobile client and its CI/CD infrastructure.

### Repository Separation

- **`mara-app` (this repo)**: Flutter client + mobile CI/CD
  - Mobile app code (Flutter/Dart)
  - Client-side observability (Sentry/Firebase)
  - Mobile testing and QA
  - GitHub Actions workflows for mobile CI/CD
  - SBOM generation for mobile dependencies

- **Backend/API (separate repository)**: Owned by another engineer
  - API endpoints
  - Backend services
  - Server-side observability
  - Backend SBOM generation
  - Database and infrastructure

**This repo is intentionally backend-agnostic.** No backend code, API endpoints, or `/health` endpoints exist in this repository by design.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## 🔒 Security & SBOM

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

This repository generates SBOMs for the Flutter mobile app dependencies:

- **Generation**: Automated via `.github/workflows/sbom-generation.yml`
- **Trigger**: On push to `main` and release tags (`v*`)
- **Output**: `sbom.json` (uploaded as artifact)
- **Location**: Generated in CI, available as workflow artifact

**Note**: Backend SBOM will be generated in a separate repository.

### Security Scanning

- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **TruffleHog**: Secrets scanning
- **Dependabot**: Dependency updates and security advisories

See `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` and `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml` for details.

## 🎨 Design

- **App Name**: Mara
- **Primary Color**: #0EA5C6 (Teal/Cyan)
- **Font**: Roboto (applied globally to every single word in the app via theme configuration)
- **Design System**: Custom theme with consistent colors and typography
- **UI Elements**: Consistent use of rounded corners (16-20px radius), shadows, and spacing

### Design Details

#### Permission Screens
- All permission screens use custom icons with color filters
- Consistent button positioning and spacing across all permission screens
- SemiBold font weight for all headlines
- Centered images with consistent styling

#### Setup Screens
- Height and Weight screens with unit selectors (cm/in, kg/lb)
- Continuous blue line under unit selectors
- Custom picker styling with selected/unselected states
- Blood type and goals screens with updated button styling
- **Reusable for Profile Editing**: All setup screens (Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Height, Weight, Blood Type, Goals) can be used both for initial onboarding and for editing from the Profile screen

#### Profile Screen
- Unified visual style with white background (#FFFFFF)
- Simple AppBar-style header with back arrow and centered "Profile" title
- Consistent row styling across all sections:
  - Row title text: #0F172A, fontWeight w500
  - Row value text: #64748B
  - Brand blue dividers (#0EA5C6) between rows
- All sections in a single scrollable page for better UX
- Developer Settings section with dynamic app version and device info

## 📱 App Icons

App icons are located in the `AppIcon/` folder. Icons are configured for both Android and iOS platforms with all required sizes.

### Updating App Icons

1. Place your icon files in the `AppIcon/` folder
2. For Android: Icons should be copied to `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher.png`
3. For iOS: Icons should be placed in `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`

## 🔐 Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

- **Camera**: For facial expression analysis and fatigue detection (processed locally)
- **Microphone**: For voice input and natural conversation
- **Notifications**: For health reminders and daily goals
- **Health Data**: For activity, sleep, and heart rate tracking

All data processing happens locally on the device for maximum privacy.

## 🌐 Navigation

The app uses GoRouter for navigation. Key routes include:

- `/splash` - Initial splash screen
- `/language-selector` - Language selection screen
- `/sign-up-choices` - Sign up options (Google, Apple, Email)
- `/sign-in-email` - Email and password sign in
- `/verify-email` - Email verification screen
- `/welcome-back` - Welcome back screen for returning users
- `/home` - Main home screen
- `/chat` - Mara chat interface
- `/analytics` - Analytics dashboard
- `/profile` - User profile (single scrollable page with all sections)
- `/settings` - App settings (legacy, now embedded in Profile)
- `/privacy-webview` - In-app privacy policy WebView
- `/onboarding-*` - Onboarding flow screens
- `/permissions-*` - Permission request screens
- `/name-input`, `/dob-input`, `/gender`, `/height`, `/weight`, `/blood-type`, `/goals` - Profile setup screens (can be accessed with `?from=profile` query parameter for editing)

### Navigation Behavior

- **Profile Screen**: Back arrow navigates to `/home` instead of going back in navigation history
- **Profile Editing**: When editing profile fields, screens check for `?from=profile` query parameter:
  - If present: After saving, navigates back to `/profile`
  - If absent: Continues normal onboarding flow

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

Run all tests with:
```bash
flutter test
```

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Widget Tests**: Test UI components and screens (see `test/ui/example_widget_test.dart`)
- **Golden Tests**: Visual regression tests (see `test/ui/example_golden_test.dart`)
  - TODO: Set up `golden_toolkit` package for proper golden testing
  - Golden tests capture widget snapshots and detect visual regressions

### Test Coverage

Test coverage is collected during CI runs. Coverage reports are available as artifacts in GitHub Actions.

**Current Coverage Goal:** 60%+ (warning threshold)  
**Future Goal:** 80%+ (enforcement threshold)

See the CI workflow for coverage collection and reporting.

## 🔧 Code Quality & Formatting

### Formatting and Linting

Before committing, run the format and lint script:

```bash
sh tool/format_and_lint.sh
```

This script will:
- Format all Dart code using `dart format .`
- Run static analysis using `flutter analyze`

The script will exit with a non-zero code if analysis fails, preventing commits with linting errors.

### Git Hooks

Git hooks automatically run code quality checks before each commit. All contributors are expected to install the hooks.

**Installation:**

Run the installation script:
```bash
sh tool/install_hooks.sh
```

This will:
- Copy the pre-commit hook to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- Make it executable
- Set up automatic formatting and linting checks

**What the hook does:**

The pre-commit hook automatically:
- Formats code with `dart format .`
- Analyzes code with `flutter analyze`
- Prevents the commit if any issues are found

**Bypassing the hook:**

You can bypass the hook with `git commit --no-verify` if needed, but this is **not recommended**. The hook ensures code quality and consistency across the project.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI)

#### Main CI Workflow
The **Frontend CI** workflow (`.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`) runs automatically on:
- Push to any branch
- Pull request to `main`

It performs:
1. Code checkout
2. Flutter setup (version 3.27.0)
3. Dependency installation (`flutter pub get`)
4. Static analysis (`flutter analyze`)
5. Test execution (`flutter test`)

Results are sent to Discord via the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_FRONTEND` secret.

#### Additional CI Workflows

**Dart Metrics** (`.github/workflows/dart-metrics.yml`):
- Code complexity analysis using `dart_code_metrics`
- File size warnings (detects files >500 lines)
- Cyclomatic complexity tracking
- Non-blocking info-level warnings (only fails on errors)
- Provides helpful summary of errors/warnings/info counts

**Documentation CI** (`.github/workflows/docs-ci.yml`):
- Lightweight CI for documentation-only changes
- Triggers only when `README.md` or `docs/**` files change
- Skips Flutter build for faster feedback
- Markdown validation
- Optional spell checking support

**Security PR Check** (`.github/workflows/security-pr-check.yml`):
- Checks for outdated dependencies (`dart pub outdated`)
- Basic secrets scanning (TruffleHog or pattern matching)
- Detects critical package updates (Flutter/Dart/Sentry/Firebase)
- Comments on PRs with outdated dependencies
- Provides security summary

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

The **Frontend Deploy** workflow (`.github/workflows/frontend-deploy.yml`) runs on:
- Push to `main` branch
- Manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`

It performs:
1. Code checkout
2. Flutter setup
3. Dependency installation
4. Version extraction from `pubspec.yaml`
5. Android APK build (`flutter build apk --release`)
6. Placeholder deploy step (ready for Firebase App Distribution / Play Store / Web hosting)

Deployment notifications are sent to Discord with details including:
- Build status (success/failure)
- Environment (production)
- App version
- Commit hash
- Total build time
- Link to workflow run

### Discord Notifications

All workflows use the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_FRONTEND` GitHub secret to send notifications to Discord.

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Create a Discord webhook in your server
2. Add the webhook URL as a GitHub secret named `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_FRONTEND`
3. Go to: `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions` → `New repository secret`

Notifications are sent for:
- ✅ CI pass/fail status
- 🚀 Deploy success/failure
- 🔀 Pull request events (opened, reopened, closed, merged)
- 🐛 Issue events (opened, reopened, closed)
- 🏷️ Release publications

### Dev Events Workflow

The **Dev Events** workflow (`.github/workflows/dev-events.yml`) handles:
- Pull request notifications (with merge detection)
- Issue notifications
- Release notifications
- Automatic PR labeling based on branch name:
  - `feat/*` → `feature` label
  - `fix/*` → `bug` label
  - `chore/*` → `chore` label

## 🐛 Crash Reporting & Observability

The app includes comprehensive observability infrastructure:

### Crash Reporting

**Implementation**: `lib/core/utils/crash_reporter.dart`

**Features**:
- ✅ Catches Flutter framework errors
- ✅ Handles async errors outside the Flutter framework
- ✅ Logs errors to console (debug mode)
- ✅ Sends to Sentry (release mode, if configured)
- ✅ Sends to Firebase Crashlytics (if enabled)
- ✅ Determines crash severity automatically

**Configuration**:
- Sentry: Set `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable or configure at runtime
- Firebase: Requires `Firebase.initializeApp()` at startup

**No backend needed**: Crashes go directly to Sentry/Firebase SaaS services.

### Analytics

**Implementation**: `lib/core/analytics/analytics_service.dart`

**Features**:
- Screen view tracking
- Custom event tracking
- User property tracking
- Firebase Analytics integration (if configured)

**Usage**:
```dart
AnalyticsService.logScreenView('home_screen');
AnalyticsService.logEvent('button_clicked', {'button_name': 'chat'});
```

**No backend needed**: Analytics go directly to Firebase Analytics.
